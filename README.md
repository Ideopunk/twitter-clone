This is a clone of Twitter, made as a final project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/final-project-116ff273-1e55-4055-bd7f-146c17d0ec9c). It includes core Twitter functionality, such as:

- Tweeting
- Interacting with the tweets of others through liking, retweeting, or replying. 
- Following and unfollowing users. 
- Adding images to tweets. 
- Notifications
- Profiles
- Hashtags
- Searches for users and hashtags
- Previews on hover


Along with practicing existing skills, new things I learned included:

- React Context
- Handling user file uploads
- Lots of promise practice
- Managing a slightly complicated database. 
- Cloud Storage with Firebase
- Code-splitting with dynamic imports
- Error-catching for Firebase.
